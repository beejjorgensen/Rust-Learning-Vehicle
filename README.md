# Rust Learning Vehicle

I'm coding up the classic game [Wizard's
Castle](https://github.com/beejjorgensen/Wizards-Castle-Info) as a way to learn
Rust.

Since this is a learning project, it's going to be weird, unstructured,
non-idiomatic, and subject to frequent refactoring.

Please don't hold it against me.
